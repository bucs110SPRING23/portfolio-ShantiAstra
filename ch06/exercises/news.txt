Lloyd Blankfein, senior chairman and former CEO of Goldman Sachs, agreed with US Sen. Sherrod Brown’s assessment that more regulation is needed to prevent a situation like Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse from happening again. 
Appearing on CNN’s Erin Burnett Outfront on Tuesday, Blankfein told host Erin Burnett that regional and smaller banks have the authority to extend the US government’s credit.
And that credit has to be protected — whether it’s a big bank or a little bank, he said. And so there’s been a number … of levels of scrutiny and regulation that applies depending on how big the banks are. But I think at this point we recognize that a 250 billion dollar bank is no small bank. And, you know, perhaps a 50 billion dollar bank is no small bank. And even smaller ones.
So, I think there’s going to be regulation that normally applies to the biggest banks will probably have to be extended. And that regulation includes bigger stress tests, having to have more capital, and other features that generally make the system safer, he said.
