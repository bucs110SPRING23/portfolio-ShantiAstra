# CS110 Midterm Exam
## Short description: a program that uses turtle-shaped turtle objects to draw a sky with a sun, moon, and a number of stars chosen by the user and randomly placed on free areas of the screen
## Known bugs and incomplete parts: The sun drawing does not have the start and endpoint at the same location - it looks slightly awkward. Cannot put a default value for a parameter that takes a turtle object. Overlap checking is currently not working properly - stars are generated that overlap with other stars, the sun, and the moon. The window.screensize() does not seem to be working properly, so stars are generated within a 500 by 500 square instead of the real screen size.

## Miscellaneous comments: the user can choose a number of stars between 0 and 50. They should be randomly generated across the screen in different sizes. Due to random generation, some final drawings look better than others.
