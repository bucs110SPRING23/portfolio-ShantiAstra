# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
A reading list tracker program that offers you random books to add to your reading list, lets you look up the definitions for words in book titles, keeps track of your reading list between runs, and provides the full text links for books that Project Gutenber offers.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
full text links and definitions sometimes do not work and I have printed an error message instead
I think the random books are generated from just the first page of results instead of the entirety of the Project Gutenberg offerings but that is still quite a few books. 

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
