# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
A reading list tracker program that offers you random books to add to your reading list, keeps track of your reading list between runs, provides the full text links for books that Project Gutenber offers, and translates the text of the books into 17 languages. 

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
translator needs an api to translate the text
library.full_text() may not be neccessary. If it is, the text has some strange markups. These may be fine if translate has format = html in it
translator needs to save the translated text as a file or link somehow to be retrieved later
