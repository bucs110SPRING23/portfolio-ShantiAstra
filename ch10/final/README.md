# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
A reading list tracker program that offers you random books to add to your reading list, lets you look up the definitions for words in book titles, keeps track of your reading list between runs, and provides the full text links for books that Project Gutenber offers full text links for.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
- full text links and definitions sometimes do not work because the APIs don't have the answers so I have printed an error message instead
- I think the random books are generated from just the first page of results instead of the entirety of the Project Gutenberg offerings but that is still quite a few books. 
- the code for dictionary.get() is a bit long and repetitive. I'm sure there is a more concise way to code it but I can't seem to figure it out. I have a giant nested mess of lists and dictionaries and I have to extract just the definitions, so it takes a while. 

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
I'm a big reader so I wanted to make something fun and useful
